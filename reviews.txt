Deck Masters insite and communication from the first meeting with Andrew was impressive. They recognized our vision from the start and built a beautiful cedar and glass solarium on our deck that is stunning. The craftsmen who worked on site were perfectionists, respectful, immaculate, and listened & acted on our input. There were no cost overrides. We will be hiring Deck Masters for future projects.

Deck Masters did a great job on our new deck! They were professional and great communicators. We sought out several quotes for our project and they provided the greatest value at the lowest cost. And once they broke ground they were impressively quick to complete the project! Highly recommend them!

We had some damage to our deck railing and stairs. We had Deck Masters add a new railing and staircase to our existing deck. We are over the moon happy with the team that showed up (Jeff, Sean & Robert) and did the work, super professional and provided top notch quality work!! Jackie provided wonderful communication and project management skills throughout the process, making it a seamless process from start to finish. Highly recommend Deck Masters!!!!

Jordan and Jackie‚Ä¶ I was surprised and pleased to meet and talk to Jefferey yesterday and this morning.  I really appreciate you following up and repairing our mildewed vinyl collars and sleeves.  Jefferey did a great job and he couldn‚Äôt be nicer.  We had a could of good, quick chats. Since we‚Äôre both life-long Alaskans, we have a bit in common.

Thanks again and, the deck looks as good as new.  Note: Jefferey caulked those collars ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù. Very clean job.

This summer was the 2nd TREX Deck built for me by Deck Masters. It was a much larger project with two levels that turned out beautifully. I had several friends over and instantly they raved about the craftsmanship and style of the Deck. Deck Masters also added decorative white lattice trim on open sides of the deck and added the same white lattice trim to a dividing fence between my yard and a neighbor. It was the perfect finishing touch to my back yard. The whole thing looks so attractive it could be on the cover of a magazine. I highly recommend this company.

We had our deck replaced by Jordan and his team, and the experience was fantastic from start to finish. They were honest, up front, and truly a pleasure to work with. Our project involved replacing a small second-story deck with a much larger one made from Trex, which was no small feat given the complexities of permitting, tight utility corridors, and the installation of pilings.

Despite these challenges, Jordan and his team delivered a beautiful result. Our new deck receives compliments constantly from neighbors and passersby. Moreover, they stood by their warranty and replaced a center support beam that had developed a large crack. Although the crack did not compromise the integrity of the beam, they wanted to ensure our complete satisfaction and replaced it without hesitation.

We highly recommend Jordan and his team for their professionalism, craftsmanship, and dedication to customer satisfaction.

Deck Masters AK we‚Äôre absolutely outstanding to work with, our project ran into roadblocks, dealing with the municipality, but they stood by us and supported every step from start to finish.

We are so thankful we went with Deck Masters AK for our new deck. We had a multi level, 20+ year old deck with too many pilings in the ground and rotting wood. We wanted a fresh new, one level deck with new piling and trex decking. We also had a hot tub on the deck which added to the chaos. We are so thankful we went with Jordan and his team. He made the quote and estimate process very easy. And the team even came in the Winter to get the job done! They worked endlessly in cold and snowy temps (especially where we are located on the hillside). The job was completed faster than we ever thought! The team on site was professional and very helpful in answering all of our questions. Inspection went perfect at the end of the job. We just couldn't be happier with Deck Masters. We would highly recommend to everyone!

"Honestly, my husband and I are just over-the-top impressed with how fast this is all getting done. We just assumed it would take quite a long time, with the season, with getting the piles out, getting the new piles in , how big our deck is , etc. We had no idea that the deck was going to be completed so quickly!! we have also just been thoroughly impressed with the crew that's been here each day. They are all super super professional, everyone is just working it seems like 115%. Everyone has been really kind and courteous. Everything seems to be cleaned each day. This is just thoroughly impressive . Quite a few of our neighbors have come over just asking who and which company was doing the deck. I wish we had a big sign that said deck master is hanging from our house. üòÇ but we were happy to pass along the info for the company . "

I whish to thank Sean and Rayne of Deck Masters for the outstanding experience I had with then as they repaired my deck.
They came out looked at the damage, formulated a plan and went to work. Despite the February weather they quickly removed all of the rotten/ broken decking and supports. Without asking they explained the repair process. Why they were doing what and why it was being done that way. The new wood was fitted into place with what, looked easy-going to me. The mess was cleaned up and the job was finished in
just two days.
I also want to thank Jackie for putting up with my phones calls. She kept me posted as to my progress on the wait list. She was always polite and upbeat.

THANKS TO ALL

Don‚Äôt look anywhere else - BEST IN THE BUSINESS in the Anchorage area! After several quotes from others, we were so confident with our choice to go with them. We had a great experience from our initial consult all the way to the installation. While there was one hiccup during installation, everything was in perfect condition not even 24 hours after expressing this to Jordan.

Professional, quick, communicative and just very, very pleasant! We are so happy with our new deck!

Replacing our 60ftx10ft deck sounded pretty intimidating for me. I put it off for several years, but knew it needed to be done...and built correctly. Jordan and his team at Deck Masters were outstanding through every step. They were so helpful in making decisions, yet never pushy at all. They even encouraged us to get a couple other quotes to make sure we wanted them to go ahead with the project. I thought decks could only be done during the summer, but the Deck Master team built our deck in less than two weeks starting the last week of November. We are excited to use our deck even more during the summer. Thank you, Jordan and team, for a job well done!

This was a great experience! First and foremost - I have a beautiful porch. Thank you!
Second - this was absolutely the nicest and sweetest group of guys. They were funny, pleasant, professional, efficient, diligent, and worked well as a team.
Third - they communicated with me. They noticed I have trouble with steps and made the steps easy for me to negotiate (no ‚ÄòAlaska steps‚Äô). They made sure t fencing around the porch was ‚Äòdog proof‚Äô - the porch is in the dog yard.
Fourth - they obviously take pride in their work. Everything is well done, and well finished to the point of being artistic.
Fifth - they were timely and coordinated - it was finished in about a total of 2 days.
Sixth - they cleaned up after themselves.
Awesome crew. Fantastic job.

This summer, we hired Deck Masters to build out our second story deck. From the initial consultation with Jordan to the final product, my wife and I were very happy with the entire process. Every question we had was answered and Jordan gave us great recommendations based on his years of experience, which helped us narrow down our decisions. During the build, Jeff, the foreman, and his team, Robert and Rayne, were friendly, professional, and efficient. They completed absolutely beautiful work.

These pictures do not do this deck justice! The workmanship is excellent right down to the last detail. But, beyond the obvious is the integrity and professionalism of Deck Masters. Jordan is an amazing young man who has created a quality company with virtue. We contracted them late in the year prior to leaving Alaska for the summer. Jordan‚Äôs crew worked during the winter months and we came home to a beautiful new deck in the spring. They took care of every issue, including working with the Muni on permitting.
They do what they say they‚Äôre going to do. Then they over deliver. You will not be sorry with Deck Masters.

Deckmasters overcame some significant design issues to deliver a very good final project.
Their workers are competent, respectful and take pride in their work.
Cost of the project is competitive compared to other deck builders in the Anchorage area.
Project started about 2 months later than original estimate and took somewhat longer than was projected.

Deck Masters AK built a roughly 5' x 24' second floor elevated deck for us and the project went well from start to finish. Matt the estimator communicated clearly and knew what he was doing and had good ideas for accomplishing our goals and giving us different options for design and materials. Travis built the deck and his craftsmanship was superior. They took care of permitting too and stayed on budget. We had a good experience.

We contracted with Jordan to have them replace our old rickety front and back decks, as well as expand the back deck significantly. Got a little delayed start due to Covid hitting and the initial lockdowns earlier this year, and some delays on the aluminum railing materials due to the pandemic, but our decks are finally complete and we couldn't be happier with the quality of construction. These decks are solid! I appreciated when they offered to extend the back deck out an extra foot at no extra cost so that there would be less wasted decking material, added approximately 40 sq. ft. Justin was meticulous and did a fantastic job! This was the only good thing to come out of 2020.

Deck Masters built a beautiful deck on the back of our house where we previously had only a small set of stairs. The deck exemplifies high quality construction and classic visual appeal. The crew was professional in all aspects of the deck construction. There were a couple of communication hiccups during the process, but Jordan was very quick to respond and work through any concerns. I believe Deck Masters truly wants their clients to be completely satisfied with their work and the decks they build.........which we are. I would definitely recommend Deck Masters to those in the market for a new deck.

Deck masters did an outstanding job with our deck; the end product looks excellent. We did have challenges with scheduling our deck construction and ended up having the build about 3 months after anticipated, and also had some minor issues along the way with miscommunication on design features that we picked up during the construction that had to be readjusted. However, I gave the company 5 stars because as soon as these issues were brought to Jordan's attention, he always complied in a professional and timely manner to get it done to our liking. I would recommend this service to others.

Jordan & his crew did an absolutely amazing job, & the craftmanship is second to none. They even picture framed the border, & made it look seamless per their construction practice. They went above and beyond what we asked for & couldn't be happier with our new decks.

We will be enjoying them for many years to come & we would totally recommend them to anybody looking for a quality built decking that is made to last through the Alaska seasons.

Timewise was longer than we hoped, but Jordan made it right and was sure to be prompt when asking for questions answered. Very professional & friendly to do business with, & we will be doing business again for future deck builds.

When my husband said he wanted a new deck I was like oh boy... here we go dealing with unresponsive contractors, haggling with quotes and playing phone tags...
To my surprise, Deck Masters reached out right away and either called or showed up in person to discuss any changes/issues.
We instantly appreciated Jordan's responsiveness and detailed explanation over the phone which is hard to find these days.
Special kudos to Isaac and Robert who have been flexible to accommodate the changes/requests along the way. They have gone above and beyond our expectation.
I can most definitely recommend Deck Masters (and I rarely recommend!)- good job guys and thank you!

Every time I shoveled snow off my decks this winter‚Äîand there were several times‚ÄîI was reminded of what a beautiful job Jordan and his crew did in building two large decks on our hillside home. From start to finish, planning (helpful ideas and permitting with subdivisions and Muni) to completion (thorough cleanup and removal of all materials), they were always professional, obsessed with quality and respectful of timelines. His price quote was competitive and he stuck to it--Even offered up a few small extras at no charge, while absorbing near continuous materials cost increases during the summer of Covid. We couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the final result, and would not hesitate to use Jordan and Two Seasons on future projects.

We have never been more satisfied with the quality and workmanship of any project we have contracted in our 42 years of marriage. Deck Masters owner, Jordan and his crew are great.. They are not only hard working, but were enjoyable to be around. They are just good people. Justin (the lead foreman) is a perfectionist and an artist. We are very fortunate that we found Deck Masters. It was a very enjoyable process from the first meeting with Kevin to the completion of the project with Jordan.

Jordan has a wonderful company staffed with competent and reliable people. They have been very responsive to what I've needed to be done and they were willing to make changes/additions/subtractions as needed. They work in any kind of weather to make sure the job is done right! They have built a deck, porch, and fence for my property. Jordan also has very good relationships with other contractors in the construction industry. It took so much pressure off of me to know he was coordinating with the landscaper, pile drivers, and driveway company.

2 years ago we hired this company to rebuild our front deck, install a partial fence-line in the back yard, and upgrade our back deck railing. After 2 hard winters, our property experienced major frost heave which affected the work that had been done. We called and notified the owner of the company, and in under 10 days, he had sent out 2 different representatives from his company to investigate and resolve the issues; at no cost to us, he and his company honored the warranty. If you're looking to build or make upgrades on your property, we would highly recommend this company.

Jordan and his team at Deck Masters AK are professional and do great work. From the moment you submit a request for a proposal, they are there to help you talk through the options and to help make your deck ideas become a reality. They were open, communicative, and built our deck within the timeline that we were given. Jordan and his team were open to communicating at every step of the way and take extreme pride in their work.

Due to safety concerns we had to replace the deck on our cabin in Willow. You would think that navigating that process from another state would be challenging. Not the case at all. We were fortunate to get connected to Deck Masters via another contractor. We explained what we wanted, saw and approved the plans and gave the go ahead to proceed. From the start of the project it was understood that we were traveling up there for vacation and the deck needed to be completed before our arrival.
Not only did Jordan and his team do a great job, they ran into some issues along the way that needed to be addressed and rather than short cut to make something work, we were made aware of these issues so we could play a role in deciding how to proceed. This communication level is key for decision making when you aren't in the same state and seeing the issues in person is not an option.
I have been a professional sales/customer service person for 20 years which comes with a high expectation when I am the customer. My expectations were exceeded every step of the way. If you need some work done and are looking for somebody you can trust, you should definitely give these folks a call!

Jordan makes sure his teammates are taken care of, making the work environment stress-free. I‚Äôm grateful to have this opportunity, and look forward to building my next Masterpiece!

Jordan worked with me to redesign and replace my front porch after the earthquake. They also replaced my fence gates. He was very patient due to delays with other work needing to be done first.
Matthew was the main carpenter and angled the walkway and porch boards. I love the artistic uniqueness of the way the front porch turned out. Also, the redone gates easily swing open with little effort.
I would recommend this company for any deck or fence work. They do a top notch job. I hope to eventually replace my fence and will be calling Deck Masters when I do.

Had an extensive remodel done to my deck. DeckMasters not only did an outstanding job but were very helpful in the design process as well. Exceptionally easy to work with and very professional personnel both in management and the site crew

For the past month, we have been enjoying the deck Jordan Webb and his team at DeckMasters built for us in Big Lake. We sought quotes from a handful of builders in the area ‚Äì some of whom never even got back to us ‚Äì and were pleased to contract with Jordan and his team, who proved to be professional, tidy, and quick. The demo of our old, dilapidated deck went smoothly and our vision for the new deck combined nicely with Jordan‚Äôs recommendations. During construction, he considered our input and communicated with us regarding any challenges and necessary changes. The deck he and his team built is well-configured, sturdy, and beautiful. We love it. We also enjoyed meeting Jordan‚Äôs young family, and appreciated how he served as a positive role model for his children. Jordan is proud of his work, and he has reason to be. We highly recommend Jordan Webb and DeckMasters!

Once Two Seasons showed up on site, they worked steadily, with high quality and attention to detail. However, they appeared about a month later than expected, after many delays. The five star rating stands because we signed a contract without a completion date. The wrong railing material was delivered, which we fortunately discovered before installation. This was corrected and the specified materials were delivered rapidly. Also, the first crew members on site were unsure of the deck width dimension. Both problems would not have happened if the crew had had a copy of the plans and a materials list. That said, due to the quality of their work and their professionalism, we would definitely work with them again.

I have to say these were the most friendly workers I have ever dealt with. To be honest it‚Äôs kind of lonely without them around. But the work they did for our deck was the best experience I had on any of our house remodel projects. Along with that, the owner made sure that we were happy with the job and even checked the work as well. I will definitely be contacting them again in the future!

Via a referral, and after researching a few other deck builders, I contacted Jordan Webb at Deck Masters, formally Two Seasons. My first hint of the type business Jordan was running was when I was greeted with an immediate response requesting a meeting at the house so he could get a feel for what my wife and would like to have done. No other builder responded to that point, and when they did they basically said for what I wanted done they didn't need to visit the site. Needless to say, I wasn't comfortable with that. Man am I glad Jordan reached out. From the beginning Jordan explained what would happen and what we could expect. It was that way through the whole build. Pretty much right away, when our old deck was demoed and hauled away, they found some water damage under the vinyl siding of the house. They pointed out the problem area and told me they could fix if I wanted it done. They also did some math and explained that if I was ok with it, they could lower the deck where it connected to the house saving material while providing a little relief to my wallet in the process. This type of interaction took place throughout the entire build and I can't stress enough how much this was appreciated. By the time they finished and moved on I felt as though I made some new friends as opposed to a business contact. You simply can't beat that in todays world. I would like to extend a special thank you to Mathew and Trey for the work and attention to detail they provided. I HIGHLY recommend Deck Masters Alaska if you're looking to add a deck to your home. It simply turned out beautiful and right on the money for what we had pictured in our mind prior meeting these gentlemen.
